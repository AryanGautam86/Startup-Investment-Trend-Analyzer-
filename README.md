<b>#About the Project

This project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline using tabular data. It supports:

- Reading and processing input data
- Training a classification/regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating model performance
- Storing results in both MongoDB and SQLite
- Saving models with `joblib` for future inference

<b>#Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting)
- ML model training and evaluation
- Model persistence using `joblib`
- Data storage in both SQLite and MongoDB
- Visualizations of accuracy and other metrics
